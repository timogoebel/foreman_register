# ForemanRegister

This plugin provides a proof-of-concept endpoint that can be used to register
an existing host to Foreman.

This can be used to bootstrap puppet on hosts that have been installed
manually. For every host a unique token is registered that allows to
enroll this host with Foreman and provision Puppet certificates on this host.

## Installation

See [How_to_Install_a_Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Plugin)
